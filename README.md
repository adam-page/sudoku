# sudoku

A Clojure library designed to solve sudoku puzzles. Currently only a brute force 
algorithm has been implemented but I plan on doing a random replacement algorithm
as well as an informed algorithm using deductive tools.

## Usage

Currently you'll have to build with Lein and/or load into a repl to run. The 
core main method simply takes an easy and a hard puzzle, solves them, verifies 
their solution and times the whole operation.
